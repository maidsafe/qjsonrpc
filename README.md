## Description

This crate provides the implementation of [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) over [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC), which is required by the [Authenticator daemon communication protocol](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_authd).

This crate exposes a minimised set of functions which are used by other crates to implement the Authenticator daemon communication protocol. On one hand the [`sn_api`](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_api) makes use of it to be able to send JSON-RPC messages to the [`authd`](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_authd) over QUIC, and on the other hand the `sn_authd` makes use of it to accept those requests from clients, generating and sending back a JSON-RPC response over QUIC. Please refer to the [sn_authd README](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_authd/blob/master/README.md) to see some examples of these types of requests/responses.
